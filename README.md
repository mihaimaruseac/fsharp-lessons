fsharp-lessons
==============

This repository holds a set of 6 presentation slides covering introductory
aspects to functional programming using F#. Since this is not a pure
functional language, slides covering interactions with .NET and non-functional
programming will also be present.

More details about this will come in time, as the lessons are given and impact
is studied.

PS: The slides are a little biased towards Haskell and Haskell related
concepts, since this is the language I like the most. However, this should not
harm in understanding the F# language via slides in this repository.
